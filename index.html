<h1>My Day</h1>
    <p>Today was an ordinary day in my life, neither good nor bad. A typical representation of my life lately.</p>

    I have been teaching computer science to third grade all year as well as teaching programming classes to some middle school students. I enjoy sharing some good computer science jokes with the students. I found this one and had it printed out and put onto my bulletin board.

    <h2>Student Life</h2>

    Mr. Hyde was remarking to me that he was becoming frustrated with students not answering him when he greeted them in the hallways between classes. I to have had this experience, need to get these kids to interact.

    <p>STEAM day 2016 was last week. All of the classes particpated. Students showed off STEAM experiments and were able to visit other classes and learn from their peers. It was a big success</p>
